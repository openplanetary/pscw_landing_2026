### Abstracts and Proceedings

[Abstracts may be submitted through the Indico portal at solarsystem.events.](https://solarsystem.events/event/1/abstracts/)

**Abstracts are solicited on any and all topics of relevance and importance to the planetary science community**, including, but not limited to, the following broad themes: planetary formation, atmospheres, surfaces, interiors; space environment and weather; habitability and astrobiology; exoplanets; software, data, tools, and methods; physical materials; field work and analog studies; missions, instruments, and technology; support for crewed missions and human exploration, including Artemis; funding and policy (esp. at NASA); community advocacy and professional development; education and outreach; diversity, equity, and inclusion; commercial space; and so on.

#### Guidelines

Abstracts are limited to 1-page, including citations and figures, and must follow the provided layout template. There must be a title composed of <200 characters. Authors and co-authors must list their full names and affiliations. The text "Planetary Science Community Workshop 2026" must appear in the document header. References may use whatever style you’d like (but please be consistent). Note that there is no lower limit on the length of an abstract. When you submit an abstract, you will be given the opportunity to request a talk, poster, either, or neither (i.e. abstract only).

There is no limit on number of abstracts that can be submitted.[^2] The first author must be the person who submits the abstract. With the exception of "abstract only" submissions, the first author of a submitted abstract must also be a registered workshop participant.

[^2]: Please do not abuse this.

Submissions by early career researchers and topics of timely and emerging interest to planetary scientists will be prioritized for talk and poster slots. [See information on the planned agenda for more.](agenda.md)


#### Proceedings

After the workshop, authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to contribute a "proceedings" document on the topic of their accepted abstract. Detailed format requirements are TBD, but proceedings documents will have no length limit. Proceedings documents will undergo editorial review by the SOC, but they will not be peer reviewed.

#### AI Use Policy

We will follow [the AI use policy of the Planetary Research Journal](https://planetary-research.org/use-of-artificial-intelligence). If you use "AI" (in any form) as part of your abstract preparation, please read and adhere to this policy.[^1]

[^1]: Briefly: "[...] the use of AI is that the authors of a manuscript are entirely responsible for the integrity of their work, regardless of whether AI was used or not."

#### Archiving and Discoverability

Any abstracts or proceedings that are accepted by the SOC will be archived in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and indexed by the [Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) and [Science Explorer](https://scixplorer.org/).
