### Logistics and lodging

The Kentucky Science Center is located in downtown Louisville KY. If flying, we recommend flying into the Muhammad Ali International Airport (SDF); other major airports in Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Nashville are all several hours drive away with no train service. There are many excellent hotels within easy walking distance of the venue. We plan to work with local hotels and the tourism board to get more specific hotel recommendations by the end of January.

The venue is handicap accessible and has a lot of power outlets and (probably) sufficient wifi capacity. We guarantee that there will be coffee / tea / water service. If the budget supports it (i.e. if enough people register), then we might be able to include breakfast and lunch catering; this will be determined by mid-March. We are looking into options for childcare. Please specify dietary restrictions or interest in childcare services in the registration form or contact the organizers if your situation changes.

There _might_ be affiliated after hours social / networking events as well, but this will be determined much closer to the workshop.
