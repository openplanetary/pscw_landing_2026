### Code of Conduct

Planetary Science Community Workshop US is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration among people who work in and around the planetary sciences.

We value the participation of each member of the planetary science community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct, as set forth by the Python Software Foundation. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

**Core Values**

* Being open. Members of the community are open to collaboration.
* Focusing on what is best for the community. We’re respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
* Acknowledging time and effort. We’re respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the research community. We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We’re receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* Showing empathy towards other community members. We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
* Being considerate. Members of the community are considerate of their peers.
* Being respectful. We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* Using welcoming and inclusive language. We’re accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

Notwithstanding the above, PCSW aims to provide a forum in which the most pressing and difficult issues facing the field of planetary science can be discussed and addressed freely and fruitfully. All participants should arrive with the understanding and expectation of lively interaction and debate.

**Our Standards**

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

**Weapons Policy**

No weapons are allowed at PSCW or any co-organized events. Weapons include but are not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

**Consequences**

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Python community Code of Conduct team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets.
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.

**The Planetary Science Community Workshop is a private event**, open only to registered and invited participants. The [organizers](organizers.md) are the final authority and will remove individuals for violating the code of conduct or for any disruptive or other behavior that places other attendees at risk or distracts from the goals and objectives of the workshop.
