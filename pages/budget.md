### Budget and Costs

The budget for this event is being entirely bootstrapped by registration fees. If we receive 50 paid registrations by January 31, then we will be able to cover baseline costs for the event. If we do not receive enough paid registrations by January 31, then we will cancel the event and all registration fees will be refunded. Total registration for the event is capped at 275 participants.
 
Baseline costs include, but are not limited to, venue and equipment rentals, insurance, coffee / tea service, materials and supplies (e.g. badges), and professional services (e.g. legal, event support). Registrations beyond the first 50 will allow us to provide an increasing level of conference support and services (e.g. breakfast or lunch catering, child care, travel grants, better coffee). Any funds remaining after expenses are covered will be donated to OpenPlanetary.
